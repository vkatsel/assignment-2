This is the "Memorizer" game.
The rules are simple:
1. You pick up the coordinates of two cards and the cards are opening
2. If the signs are the same, those cards are left open
3. If the signs are different, cards are closing, and you're given another try
4. In the end you'll see your score
Good luck and enjoy!
